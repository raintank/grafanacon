      talk: ELI5 - What I Learned Teaching Grafana to My Kids
      description: |
        Take away some plans and starter code for how to use Grafana at home for whimsical and educational purposes. Inviting family to do these projects with us is a great way to help them understand what we do at work all day! But the benefits extend far beyond keeping a child entertained. 

        We’ll conclude with some thoughts about how we can take these lessons and apply them towards making our own workplaces better. We can all strive to “Explain it like I’m five” to each other more often -- not to be patronizing, but to encourage a culture of tinkering and playfulness, without the fear of breaking things.

      description: |
        Have you thought about running Grafana exposed to everyone on the internet? Probably not!

        At GitLab we value transparency, so this is exactly what we do. Every metric we use for running gitlab.com is visible to the public.

        This talk will give an overview of how we operate Grafana, Prometheus, Trickster, and Thanos to create both internal and external dashboards.

      talk: How not to Fail at Data Visualization
      description: |
        Grafana, with its huge amount of data sources and plugins, has all the capabilities one needs to create accurate graphs. Although creating dashboards is easy, interpreting each panel is hard if it's not correctly visualised. Misinterpretation is one of the most common causes of wrong conclusions that make us hunt ghosts during debugging sessions. There are many common pitfalls which we can avoid if we follow some rules. 

        Learn about some of the most common mistakes in visualizations and how to avoid them.

      talk: Reveal Your Deepest Kubernetes Metrics
      description: |
        Kubernetes generates a wealth of metrics from several places. Some explicitly within the Kubernetes API server, the Kublet, and cAdvisor or implicitly by observing events such as the kube-state-metrics project. A subset of these metrics are used within Kubernetes itself to make scheduling decisions, however, other metrics can be used to determine the overall health of the system or for capacity planning purposes.

        In this session you will learn about:

        * Node level metrics, as exposed from the node_exporter
        * Kublet metrics
        * API server metrics
        * etcd metrics
        * cAdvisor metrics
        * Metrics exposed from kube-state-metrics

        Learn about how these metrics are calculated, their use within Kubernetes scheduling decisions and application in monitoring, alerting and capacity planning.

    title: Why Should I Attend GrafanaCon? *
    subtitle: "\n * And how do I get my boss to send me?"
    content: |
      **1. Learning is fundamental.** It goes without saying that there’s a lot of information to be had at a GrafanaCon. Because so many different people have embraced Grafana—from the monitoring tinkerer to Fortune 500 companies—GrafanaCon provides the opportunity to get first-hand accounts of monitoring at every scale. Here you can learn monitoring best practices from companies like eBay and Uber, and the ins and outs of the latest open source monitoring tools. GrafanaCon isn’t just about Grafana; it also encompasses the open source monitoring ecosystem at large. You can find out more about Prometheus, Graphite, InfluxDB, Kubernetes, and others. At the last GrafanaCon, attendees heard from more than 30 speakers over two days, covering topics ranging from [how Bloomberg built its monitoring infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6AoyEovSa4), to an overview of [the RED Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk77VS98Em8) of instrumenting services (from its creator!), to a preview of the new [Flux Query Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asHISf26zTg). 

      **2. Networking opportunities galore.** Social media can bridge distance, and websites contain a wealth of information, but neither can be a true substitute for the energy of face-to-face interaction and instruction. Here’s your chance to meet your LinkedIn connections and open source co-contributors in real life. Find like-minded people, curious fellow engineers, hobbyists, and people just learning about time series data, data visualization, and open source software. While GrafanaCon has grown year over year, we believe it’s still an intimate environment where people can really get to know their tribe. In addition to the sessions, there are lunches, breaks, and an after-hours party scheduled for attendees to get their networking on.

      **3. Hands-on demos.** Where else can you get all the industry leaders and experts in one room? GrafanaCon is the perfect place to learn about new features in Grafana, get in-depth demos and tutorials, tips and tricks, and learn about new products in the extended Grafana landscape—all from the founders and creators themselves. 

      **4. Be part of the open source software community.** More than ever, Fortune 500 companies and other enterprises realize the significant business value of open source software: more rapid feature releases, better code quality, reduced vendor lock-in, reduced costs. And as more and more companies adopt these technologies, being a part of the open source software community is valuable to its employees, too. It’s like a stamp of approval on your CV. Attending GrafanaCon can help you learn how to navigate an open source project, make contributions, and build relationships with maintainers and fellow contributors—all skills that can help you do your current job (or get your dream job).

      **5.  You’ve got wisdom to impart, too.** You’ve been in the trenches, so you have your own monitoring story to tell. At GrafanaCon, the experiences you’ve had and the lessons you’ve learned can be immensely valuable to your fellow attendees. You could even be the hero!  

      **6. Invest in yourself.** You’re awesome, and you’re worth it. Not only will you come back from GrafanaCon recharged with new ideas on monitoring and observability to benefit your company, but you’ll also get the chance to grow both professionally and personally.

      **7. Share with your coworkers.** Bring what you’ve gleaned back to your colleagues. You can even host a meetup or a training session, and invite your new GrafanaCon connections. Learning new things is great, but passing on what you’ve learned to others is priceless.

      **8. Have fun.** While the problems we solve through monitoring are important for businesses, we want to provide a safe, supportive, and above all, fun experience. Work hard, play hard: Break out of your shell, and come home with some new life-long connections. Our after-conference receptions are always fun, whether we’re bowling in NYC or hanging out at an arcade in Amsterdam. Also: swag.

      Guess what? All of the above can be cited to convince your boss to send you to GrafanaCon. (Okay, maybe not #8. And lose the references to your CV.) 

      We understand that conferences can be expensive—the price of the ticket, travel, lodging, meals, and time off from our actual jobs. But think about what you get in return: the opportunity to get hands-on trials of new tools, learn how monitoring is implemented at scale by some of the biggest companies in the world, and crowdsource solutions for monitoring issues we’ve all struggled through. You’ll come back to work invigorated and inspired, armed with new ways of looking at and transforming the data you collect, important industry connections, and fresh ideas that will ultimately help you and your business succeed. Isn’t that worth your while?

# !CONDUCT
# ------------------------------------------------------------

conduct:
  title: Code of Conduct
  content: |
    All representatives, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any GrafanaCon event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

    ## The Quick Version
    GrafanaCon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

    ## The Less Quick Version
    Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

    Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

    Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for GrafanaCon.

    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff will be visible by their special badges and clothing.

    Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

    We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.
