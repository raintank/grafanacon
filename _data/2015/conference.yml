    title: Join us for GrafanaCon NYC and the Launch of Grafana 4.0
    content: |
      ### **New York, NY • Thursday, October 15, 2015 - Squarespace HQ**
      
      Spend an evening discussing Grafana, the leading open source graph and dashboard composer for visualizing time series metrics. This conference will feature talks by Grafana creator Torkel Ödegaard, as well as users and contributors from the Grafana community. The point of this conference is to come together to discuss how to make the most of the data you're collecting.
      We plan to cover general information about using and getting the most out of Grafana, tips on building dashboards, in-depth feature demos, how-to's, and Q&A sessions; finishing the afternoon discussing the future of Grafana. We'll also be enjoying pizza and beer during the event. Everyone is welcome, and the best part is, it's **free**!

      talk: Grafana and MySQL - Benefits and Challenges
      description: |
        Philip will be talking about his experiences with Grafana and MySQL. In an enterprise environment it is sometimes necessary to keep data in a traditional, general purpose SQL database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. This talk will explore the challenges and benefits of using Grafana with an SQL database in a large enterprise production setting.

      talk: Alerting "in" Grafana
      description: |
        Dieter will be talking about alerting “in” Grafana. As one of the most requested features in our last survey, and one of the most active open GitHub issues, alerting in Grafana is both an exciting and contentious topic. Dieter will discuss our approach to tackling the alerting question in Grafana, and what’s coming down the pipe to allow people to manage their alerts side-by-side with their visualizations.

      description: |
        Jesse will be talking about OpenNMS, an enterprise grade network management application platform that can be used to collect a wide array of metrics from network devices and services. Until recently, the only means of visualizing these metrics was through static images. Jesse will share his experiences developing and maintaining a custom data source that allows OpenNMS users to leverage the powers of Grafana.
