      ### **New York, NY • Thursday, October 15, 2015 - Squarespace HQ**

      Spend an evening discussing Grafana, the leading open source graph and dashboard composer for visualizing time series metrics. 

      This conference will feature talks by Grafana creator Torkel Ödegaard, as well as users and contributors from the Grafana community. The point of this conference is to come together to discuss how to make the most of the data you're collecting.
      
      We plan to cover general information about using and getting the most out of Grafana, tips on building dashboards, in-depth feature demos, how-to's, and Q&A sessions; finishing the afternoon discussing the future of Grafana. We'll also be enjoying pizza and beer during the event. Everyone is welcome, and the best part is, it's **free**!

      talk: Grafana and MySQL - Benefits and Challenges
      description: |
        Philip will be talking about his experiences with Grafana and MySQL. In an enterprise environment it is sometimes necessary to keep data in a traditional, general purpose SQL database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. This talk will explore the challenges and benefits of using Grafana with an SQL database in a large enterprise production setting.

      talk: Alerting "in" Grafana
      description: |
        Dieter will be talking about alerting “in” Grafana. As one of the most requested features in our last survey, and one of the most active open GitHub issues, alerting in Grafana is both an exciting and contentious topic. Dieter will discuss our approach to tackling the alerting question in Grafana, and what’s coming down the pipe to allow people to manage their alerts side-by-side with their visualizations.

      talk: Tales of a Custom Data Source
      description: |
        Jesse will be talking about OpenNMS, an enterprise grade network management application platform that can be used to collect a wide array of metrics from network devices and services. Until recently, the only means of visualizing these metrics was through static images. Jesse will share his experiences developing and maintaining a custom data source that allows OpenNMS users to leverage the powers of Grafana.

# !CONDUCT
# ------------------------------------------------------------

conduct:
  title: Code of Conduct
  content: |
    All representatives, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any GrafanaCon event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

    ## The Quick Version
    GrafanaCon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

    ## The Less Quick Version
    Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

    Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

    Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for GrafanaCon.

    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff will be visible by their special badges and clothing.

    Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

    We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.
