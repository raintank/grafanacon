    content: |
      Join the Grafana team and hundreds of monitoring and data aficionados for two days of content and speakers from across the Grafana ecosystem, led by Torkel Odegaard, the creator of Grafana.

      Set aboard The Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum, this Essex-class aircraft carrier boasts one of the most varied aircraft collections on the east coast, stunning views of the Hudson River and, did we forget to mention, a space shuttle!?

      **Day 1:** Single track talks and panels of general interest.

      **Day 2:** Dual track format, with more detailed topics and deeper dives. 

      Day two will also have a plugin lounge with projects from across the ecosystem including Prometheus, Graphite, InfluxDB, worldPing, Kentik, Voxter, Circonus, Crate.io, NS1 and many others.

      Ticket includes breakfast & refreshments both days and entry to the official after party which is being held at Lucky Strike Manhattan.
