      talk: What's New In Graphite
      description: |
        I started working on Graphite just over a year ago, to help out with some issues blocking the Graphite 1.0 release. Little did I know that a year later, that would have resulted in 262 commits (and counting), and that with the help of the other Graphite maintainers, we would have added a huge amount of new functionality to Graphite.

        In this talk I’ll give a tour of some of the highlights including tag support, syntax and function updates, custom function plugins, and python 3.x support.

      talk: The Design of IFQL, the New Influx Functional Query Language
      description: The new InfluxDB query language is functional in nature. Conceptually it looks like D3 or jQuery. Functions are chained off each other. This gives greater flexibility for what the language can do and opens up new possibilities for UI builders. This talk will cover the details of the language and user interface ideas that can pair up nicely with it. We'll look at query examples that perform math on metrics, interpolation, and similarity measures.

      talk: Writing Grafana dashboards with Jsonnet
      description: |
        Jsonnet is a tool that allows you to write Json files easily, handle repetitions, data, etc.

        Terraform is a tool that works with may API's to create/update/delete objects from a codebase. It is mainly known in the cloud area but has support for grafana too.

        Combining those two solutions allows you to write many dashboards in no time - in a reproducible way. And even to create basebricks for multiple dashboards and reuse them at will.

      description: Natel Energy is building a low cost, distributed, grid-scale hydropower turbine. We began using traditional industrial control packages to manage and develop our projects. These products tend to be expensive, fragile, hard to scale and ugly. With Grafana, we found a great platform to build a good looking, secure and scalable control system. Rather than build a new application we are now building all our operational interfaces directly in Grafana plugins.

      talk: When Performance Metrics and User Experience Come Together
      description: |
        When performance metrics are combined with active user experience and machine learning, we can gain new insights about why a business critical application is slow, what components are involved, and how this impacts users and hardware.

        By interlinking several levels of dashboards, users from different departments can get a more transparent view of the issue and exchange problem related information as easy as sending a hyperlink to a specific dashboard to their colleagues. Thus troubleshooting and root case detection become much easier.

        But collecting up to 500 mio datapoints per day per customer is not trivial.

      talk: Graphs Tell Stories
      description: |
        Dave just started his new job as a Systems Engineer in this strange IT company. His ambition is to become the most aspiring and omniscient operator the company has seen.

        Through his journey of debugging issues and hunting users he learns many things helping him to troubleshoot and improve running systems. Unfortunately, at some point in his career, Dave reaches a moment where none of the learned techniques can't help him.

        What he needs is something that that can display all the data he collects with different tools in one single place.

        This story is about how the art of data visualisation can change your whole perspective and help you find the right answers.

      talk: Storage monitoring at Shell Upstream
      description: |
        After insourcing the majority of subsurface technical storage at Shell uptream, we were limited by the commercially available monitoring solution. A Proof of Concept was held using a data collector, InfluxDB and Grafana. This enabled us to monitor the full globally installed base on a single dashboard as well as drilling deep into specific storage clusters.

        We'll show the interesting and completely unexpected advantages of implementing Grafana and the insights we've gained.

      talk: "The RED Method: How To Instrument Your Services"
      description: The RED Method defines three key metrics you should measure for every microservice in your architecture. It gives developers a template for instrumenting their services and building dashboards in a consistent, repeatable fashion. We will discuss patterns of application instrumentation, where and when they are applicable, and how they can be implemented with Prometheus. We’ll cover Google’s Four Golden Signals, the RED Method, the USE Method, and Dye Testing. We’ll also discuss why consistency is an important approach for reducing cognitive load, and discuss the limitations of these approaches and what can be done to overcome them.

      description: |
        Amgen has been on a journey to confront the multi-million dollar elephant in the room. Technical debt that had been passed down for 10 years in their monitoring portfolio.

        But how to overcome inertia and a failure to understand how to maximize internal value for data that belongs to organization to begin with?

        I'll discuss lessons learned, where it was, where it is now, and what steps we took to achieve technical value given back to the business through open source, modular layers and with a design for programmatic monitoring at global enterprise scale.

      talk: "Grafanalib: Dashboards as Code"
      description: |
        Grafana has a great UI for creating dashboards, but what happens when you want to start implementing common patterns, or change your dashboard at the same time that you change your monitoring?

        Why not treat your dashboards like code? We do that with grafanalib, which is a Python EDSL for building Grafana dashboards.

        This talk will show how you can use grafanalib to manage your dashboards, some cool things you can do with it, and talk a little bit about its design & internals.

      talk: The Journey of Shifting the MQTT Broker HiveMQ to Kubernetes
      description: |
        From zero to Kubernetes: Which challenges do I face while migrating a cloud-unready Java application such as HiveMQ from a classical Linux IT- environment to Docker-Orchestrator Kubernetes?

        In this talk we want to show you the technical problems we had to solve and how monitoring setup helped us to handle critical incidents in production.

      talk: Graphite@Scale or How to Store Millions of Metrics per Second
      description: |
        This is a story about dealing with metrics at scale. A lot of metrics.

        This is our story of the challenges we’ve faced at Booking.com and how we made our Graphite system handle millions of metrics per second.

        You should expect to learn about one of the most high load Graphite stacks, the problems it poses and the challenges in maintaining it and scaling it further, pushing Graphite to its limits and beyond.

      talk: Bringing Observability to the Built Environment at City Scale
      description: |
        Since 2013 New City Energy has been helping the City of D.C. measure and improve the efficiency and performance of its building portfolio through a number of policy and technology innovations. In 2016, NCE began building out a cloud based platform to allow deep insight to the portfolio at a room-by-room level.

        Learn how we've structured the architecture to enable this platform, the context of how Grafana interacts with the other components in the system, and how the entire system delivers value to the City.

      talk: Using PostgreSQL, Prometheus & Grafana for Storing, Analyzing and Visualizing Metrics
      description: |
        In this talk, we take a somewhat heretical stance in the monitoring world, and describe why and how we chose to use PostgreSQL as a Prometheus backend to support complex queries (and get a full SQL interface).

        Until recently, the databases supported by Grafana have been NoSQL systems, offering SQL-like or custom query languages that were limited in scope, and designed for specific data model and architectures in mind.
